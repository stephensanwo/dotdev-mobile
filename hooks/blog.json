Then you switch to another project B on your local machine, and you install the same packageX but version 2.0, which has some breaking changes between version 1.0 and 2.0. All of a sudden when you go back to run your project A, you get all sorts of errors, and your app does not run. This is a practical scenario you can run into when building software with python, and to get around this, we use Virtual Environments. This tutorial will cover everything you need to know about virtual environments and how to set it up.",
